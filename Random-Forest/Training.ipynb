    "# What I'm trying to do. \n",
    "- In this code I am trying to make better predications for the titanic dataset that I have, in hopes that it will perform  better than my decision tree.  \n",
    "# Imports\n",
    "- pandas: pandas are used to load and manipulate the dataset.\n",
    "- sklearn import tree: This gives the plot_tree method which is used to visualize a decision tree.\n",
    "- sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier: This implements the random forest algorithm, allowing me to combine multiple decision trees together for better accuracy.\n",
    "# What is going on\n",
    "- Male and Female are converted to numerical values. with 0 = male and 1 = female. \n",
    "- In the dataset, there is missing values for the Age field, because of this I have it set so that where the missing values for Age are filled it with a median, to ensure that no data is missing. \n",
    "- Setting up a variable named features, this will use pclass, Sex and Age for predictions. \n",
    "- we set x as features with y being the target, which is whether they have survived or not.  \n",
    "- For working the Random Forest I use RandomForestClassifier which uses N-estimators, this is the number of decision trees that are in the forest. max_depth, this manages how far down the decision trees will go, having a limit on it makes the decision tree more readable and helps to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "# Problems encountered\n",
    "- For displaying the graph, as each image is different (each decision tree is a different decision tree taken from the Random Forest) there is a chance that the information being displayed could be hard to read or overlap with each other. I have tried a few different things to prevent this, such as reducing the max_depth however these problems still persist. "
